# IoT-ENV

IoT-ENV is a project developed by Eva Vivas and Giacomo Napoli.
This project aims for monitoring environmental parameter to local weather forecast in a big urban area. The main idea is to give the possibility to have weather forecast of different urban area at the end-user, within a big city (see Figure 1). To achieve this goal, we want develop a smart IoT device to monitoring environmental parameters through some sensors (temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind direction and velocity), which are suitable to supply information about the current environmental situation. These devices will be spread in the urban area in order to supervise several zones. The communication is done by a main server that takes care of collecting the whole data and; therefore, it does exposure the forecasts through the web or a mobile application.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
